# Bliro Coding Challenge
Hello there! Here you find a single file dummy NodeJS API that you CAN use for your code_challenge. 

You need nodeJS installed on your machine to use it though. If you don't have nodeJS yet, you can install it from the website https://nodejs.org/en/. 

If you don't want to install nodeJS, you can also submit the coding challenge with an asyncronous function to emulate the API. 

Once you setup nodeJS on your machine here are the instructions to run the nodeJS server. 

1. Clone or Fork this repository

2. Navigate into your local copy of this repo and hit `npm install -y`. 

3. Run `node index.js`

4. If you now visit https://localhost:5001, you should get a warm message back. 

Let's get our hands dirty!
